# Cereal Shop Discount API
This Ruby on Rails API provides a "Buy X Get Y" discount feature for a cereal shop's shopping cart. This feature is designed to offer customers a special holiday promotion. Customers who purchase a qualifying product from a designated list receive a discount on an additional product from a separate list of eligible items.

## üìù Features
  - Customizable Discounts: Customers purchasing items from the "X" list qualify to receive a discount on an item from the "Y" list.
  - Intelligent Discount Application: The API applies the discount to the least expensive item within the eligible list, ensuring the best possible offer.
  - JSON Response: Returns the discounted price for each item in the cart and the final total cost after discounts.
    
## üîß Technology Used
  - Ruby on Rails: MVC framework for building a scalable and robust API.
  - RSpec: Testing framework to ensure the reliability and quality of the API

## üìä Project Structure
  - app/models - Models for Cart and Line Item.
  - app/services - The DiscountCalculator service, encapsulates the discount calculation logic.
  - app/controllers - Controller for handling the API endpoint.
  - spec - Automated tests to ensure API accuracy.
